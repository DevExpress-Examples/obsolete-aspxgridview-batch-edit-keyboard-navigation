⛔ DEPRECATED. This example demonstrated how to change the order of focusing ASPxGridView cells by pressing the Tab key when the Batch Edit mode is used. Starting with v16.1, a similar functionality is available out of the box. Set the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.GridBatchEditSettings.StartEditAction">SettingsEditing.BatchEditSettings.StartEditAction</a> property to `FocusedCellClick` to activate it. 

You can try this functionality in the following online demo:
